Echo-Scrape is an AI-powered web scraping assistant that extracts structured data from raw HTML using prompt engineering and LLMs. Users enter a website URL, view the DOM content, and receive an auto-suggested parsing prompt based on inferred intent and labels. The system supports dynamic examples, prevents duplicates, and uses real-world HTML samples for accurate extraction. Built with Streamlit, it integrates ChromeDriver for scraping and includes fallback logic, prompt generation, and a self-updating JSON example bank.
